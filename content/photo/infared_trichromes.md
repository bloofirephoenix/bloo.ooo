over the summer i tried taking some infared trichromes. it went *okay*.

a trichrome is a color photo made up of 3 black and white photos, one with a red filter, one with a blue filter, and one with a green filter. in this case i was using an infared filter instead a red filter.

i shot this using 35mm rollei infared film.

this is the first one i took. i think it looks okay but not great. i would have liked more detail in the trees. the sky looks crazy though.

this one is the best one. i think its because its the only one with a properly exposed infared channel. the rest of them were very blown out.

this one is also really good. i love the way the rainbowy colors are on the tree and the person.

i dont like this one as much. the colors hurt my eyes a little.

with this one i decided to experiment with shadows. they become rainbowy apparently. it looks pretty cool. the image is still a little bright though.

this one also hurts my eyes to look at. its just so bright.

# conclusion
i think these photos turned out good considering they were my first attempts at this. i have more photos i never got around to processing. if i want to go further with this i will have to get better with exposing the infared photo as they were all very blown out.
