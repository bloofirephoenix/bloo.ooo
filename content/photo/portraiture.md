this project started a few months ago with the idea to create trichromes of people in full color surrounded by other people in only one of the colors. if you dont know, a trichrome is when you take a color photo using three black and white photos taken with a red, green, and blue filter. this project has one of them, you'll know it when you see it. the project quickly evolved into double exposures of people in black and white.

i had never taken portraiture before this project, so it was a learning experience in that way. 

i also used only medium format cameras for this, the mamiya 645 super and pentax 6x7. my photo teacher sat me down and said "if you *really* care about your negatives you should only use your medium format cameras". well shit i guess i do care about my negatives, better only use medium format.

printing this project was really fun but shooting it really wasnt. i am a shy person and asking to take peoples photo is like my worst nightmare. about half way through this project i felt at the end of my ropes, with two rolls left to shoot. i laid down on the floor and announced "i think im ready to quit photography". absolute drama queen for sure.

by the numbers, i shot 5 rolls of film for this project. one on my 35mm cannon as a test roll, three on my mamiya 645, and two on my pentax 6x7. i developed all the rolls in my school's darkroom. i created half of the prints in my home darkroom. the trichrome is a digital print.

overall, im quite happy with this project. i dont feel the need to do another portraiture project though.
