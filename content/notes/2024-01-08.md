i had a weird dream last night. i dreamed god told me i was going to die that night. i would pass peacefully in my sleep. i was pretty chill about it though. i handed over my login info to my friend and went to bed. it was very sentimental for me. i drifted off to sleep as god told me my time had come and it was time to let go. so i did. it was oddly emotional and yet calming.

maybe i shouldnt read my humanities books before bed
